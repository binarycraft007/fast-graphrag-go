# DOMAIN

{{.example_queries}}

# STEPS
1. Identify all entities of the given types. Make sure to extract all and only the entities that are of one of the given types, ignore the others. Use singular names and split compound concepts when necessary (for example, from the sentence "they are movie and theater directors", you should extract the entities "movie director" and "theater director").
2. Identify all relationships between the entities found in step 1. Clearly resolve pronouns to their specific names to maintain clarity.
3. Double check that each entity identified in step 1 appears in at least one relationship. If not, add the missing relationships.
